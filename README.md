Boris Bikes

### Boris Bikes Application

Putting my understanding of basic Ruby to the test for the first time, this TDD project in object orientated programming implemented a basic infrastructure for organising boris bikes. This was the first exercise I undertook in which different classes and modules interacted with each other (bikes, docks, vans and garage) and was driven by the testing framework RSpec.
